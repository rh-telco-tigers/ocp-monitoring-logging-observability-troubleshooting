Openshift has components related to monitoring, logging, and observability built right into the product.  All of these are either ingrained into the web console or can easily be configured through an operator.

Using straight upstream Kubernetes, or many of the other platforms in the marketplace that are built based on Kubernetes, often do not have the built-in integrations (dashboards) and tooling (operators) in place like Openshift does.

These integrations are not simply third-party add-ons that can be installed where you are left alone to work with another vendor to install, operate, and troubleshoot.  With Openshift, all of these functions are vetted, tested, and supported as part of the Openshift subscription.  This means a lower cost of ownership when compared to our competitors.

In this article, I will show the many ways this information can be visible to your operations team.  These visualizations can be used to build nice dashboards and establish troubleshooting and MOP (Method of Procedure) for these operations' teams.

This article will cover the following:

The visualizations that are built-into the OCP web console.

Observability Menu in Web Console to include Alerting and Metrics.

The Network Observability Operator.

Advanced Cluster Management application and policy visualizations.

Openshift Logging.

Openshift Service Mesh.

Debugging applications using OC-command tooling (cmd-line).

Debugging node issues using OC-command tooling (cmd-line).
